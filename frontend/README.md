# Web-Frontend

This contains the React/JavaScript code for our project's frontend.

## Setup

1. Install npm and Node.
   - npn i express mongoose path nodemon
2. After you clone this repo, run `npm install` to install all the libraries. This should create a folder `node_modules` in the repo root folder.
3. Run `npm start` to start the frontend. It will most likely run on `localhost:3019`
