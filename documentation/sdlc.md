# Planning

**Problem**

Almost often when a high student finish writing the examination in form 5, they begin the think of themselves as universty students and some think of transforming their dreams into practice. With the lack of knowledge of the programs, or so-called courses at that stage, they often fall into a trap of picking some programs because of the following reasons:
- They are advised to
- They heard about them in TV, social media, movies or so on
- They have been longing to do them
- They have no other option but do them if they are willing to attend varsity or college

When looked at from a shallow perspective, these reasons might be satisfactory but it is worth noting that whatever reason leads to the user picking a program, it will punish the student for the rest of his/her life if not taken with detailed knowledge. Now, we have established the need for better decision making within student when making such life-changing decisions.

On top of that, when applying, students are required to go from one university to then next college and to the next college in search for programs they qualify for. As you can tell already, this costs a lot of money. Further, you are required to take hard copies of application letters, hand-in filled forms.

Another issue pertains to the dates of applications. Students are usually not aware of when application opens and closes at a respective university, nor do they know about the applications, acceptance and all costs associated with applying at an university.

This is a big problem because judging from the perspectives introduced, there is a huge information gap which then causes major disruptions in potential careers and/or study lives. This issue is prevailing and no know has yet attempted to solve it. Well, we have mulitple organizations looking into single segments of a bigger issue and our proposed approach focuses all the segments. To be honest, the problem extends beyond the stated boundaries and because of our scope, time constaraits, and resource limitations, we will only focus on the stated segemnts and in the future, once we're able, we are going to extend the scope.

**Project scope**

The first/index page which should be rendered by the server when running this website is the landing page which should serve as a marketing agent and details:
<li>all about the company</li>
<li>the services we render</li>
<li>client reviews</li>
<li>frequently asked questions</li>
<li>The page should have steps to perform in order to accomplist the application process</li>

The purpose of this page should get the user started. Therefore, the most important links should be on buttons called get started, login, signup. In essense, get the user started.

Once you click on Signup, you are going to have a form which will be filled with you details including your password, and username. Once you register, the assumption is that you are ready to get going and so we need to take you to the login page and autofill the details needed since we have them from your signup. This is an intelligent feature will enhance user experience. Here, all you need to do is click on the login button and this lands you to the home page.

In the home page, it is where you are going to be allowed to access our services since you are already authenticated. There are some links which should get you started and the services are:
<li>Fill the form with your information</li>
<li>Upload the document with your symbols or certificate</li>
<li>Chat with the model to get your recommendations</li>

For now, we will only implement this scope and going forward we will do a thorough analysis of features to add, remove, or modify in this project. We will do that through the use of prototyping where we are going to follow these steps:
1. Making an MVP - Minimal Viable Product
2. Engage the user
3. Implement the changes based on the feedback of the users
4. Continue to loop until the project is considered to be good. When looked at at the perspective of the Software Development Life Cycle, we will implement this step at the maintenace stage of our project development.


**Threats, Constraints, security concerns**
In this section we're going to delve into the weaknesses and limitations of the proposed system, from a high-level perspective.

Well, with the for-now shallow project scope we only have one major security concern and that is the fact that students are going to be required to upload their symbols or form 5 certificates so that our system can be able to capture the subjects, scores or grades and other vital information. This is an issue because we do not have a strong security, nor do we have an detailed incident response that can be used when we face issues.
